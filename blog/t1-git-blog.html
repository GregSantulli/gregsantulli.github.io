      <h4> T1: GIT, GITHUB, AND THE BENEFITS OF VERSION CONTROL</h4>

      <p id="blog_text">
          <strong>Version Control</strong> is the process of storing and managing changes made to a set of data or repository. When working with a set of data that is frequently changing and updating (ie: websites, programs), it is useful to have a sytem that can easily track each change, allowing users to understand when, how and why a change was made. This is also very useful for fixing errors as it allows you to revert back to an earliar version of the data.  Version control also allows multiple users to work on the a single file simultaneously. <br><br>

          <img class="small" src="../imgs/git-logo.png"/><strong>Git</strong> is a popular version control system that 'commits' changes to data, keeping track of the user, date, and time of the change. Git also saves a massage with each commit, allowing the user to describe eaxatly what is being changed and why. Git also allows users to to create a 'branch' or identical copy of the current data. This is extremely beneficial when many people are working on the same set of data; each user can modify their own branch without affecting the main "trunk" of data. Changes to each branch can then be merged into the main trunk once it is ready.<br><br>

          <img class="small" src="../imgs/gh-logo.svg"/><strong>GitHub</strong> is an online hub where users from around the globe can collaborate on the same data. As the name suggests, it is quite literally a Hub for Git repositiories. By 'pushing' and 'pulling' data from GitHub, users can share and develop data remotely, while at the same time keeping close track of all changes.
