      <h4>C3: THINKING STYLE</h4>

      <p class="blog_text">
        Anthony F. Gregorc, Ph. D., is internationally recognized for his work in learning styles which began in 1969 with the introduction of his Energic Model of Styles. This work evolved into the Mind Styles Model in 1984. Gregorc's Mind Styles model provides an organized way to consider how the mind works. Gregorc has divided these mind styles into four groups:

        <ul>
          <li>Concrete Sequential</li>
          <li>Concrete Random</li>
          <li>Abstract Random</li>
          <li>Concrete Random</li>
        </ul>
 <p class="blog_text">

Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.<br><br>

   Concrete Random Thinkers are experimenters.<br><br>

   Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.<br><br>

   Abstract Sequential Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.<br><br>

   No style is superior; they are simply different. Each style can be effective in its own way. Once a person understands how they think, they will be able to better hone their learning capabilities.
