    C4: ISSUES IN TECH
  </h4>

  <div class="content">

      It's no secret that the technologoy sector is largely white and male. This stereotype only worsens as you focus on executives. Google published a breakdown of their 46,000-person workforce in July 2014, and the findings only reinforced this lack of diversity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thirty percent of Google's employees worldwide are women, according to the figures released in May, and just 17 percent of technical staffers are female.Racially and ethnically, Google's U.S.-based staff is 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian, 3 percent Hispanic, and 2 percent African-American.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a huge discrepancy when compared to the US workforce as a whole: 47 percent of U.S. workers are women, 80 percent are white, 12 percent are black and 5 percent are Asian.
    </p>

    <p>
      A possible reason for this discrpancy is not that Google or other tech companies discriminate when hiring applicants, but rather these statistics reflect the current state of the technlogy sector. There is an underlying issue with the pipeline: Companies can only hire the people who apply for jobs, and in tech, those people tend to be male and white.

      Righ now, women earn roughly only 18 percent of all computer science degrees in the United States. Further, research has shown that girls tend to pull away from STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), while rates of boys in these classes stay steady.
    </p>

    <p>
      A possoble solution to the lack of diversity in technology may lie in the current grade school cirriculum. Right now, a student can graduate high school without having much exposure to computer technology at all. However, if we intruduce computer science at an earlier age (as we do with mathematics or history) it is possible that these subject will catch on with women and minorities.

      "A 2009 study tested various messages about computer science with college-bound teens. It found that explaining how programming skills can be used to 'do good' — connect with one's community, make a difference on big social problems like pollution and health care — reverberated strongly with girls. Far less successful were messages about getting a good job or being 'in the driver's seat' of technological innovation — i.e., the dominant cultural narratives about why anyone would learn to code."

      Perhaps if we started teaching computer literacy as we do english or mathematics, we would start to see the technology sector reflect the demographics of the US as a whole.
