    <p>
      Pair programming is a development technique in which two programmes work on one workstation. One programmer assumes the role of the <em>driver</em>, and the other is the <em>navigator</em> (also known as the <em>observer</em> or <em>pointer</em>).
    </p>
      The <strong>driver</strong> types the code while the <strong>navigator</strong> dictates the code to be types and reviews it as it is typed in. The navigator is also responsible for the overall direction and strategy of the program. This allows the driver to focus on the technical detail and syntax of the program. Pairs can switch these roles many times throughout the coding process.
    <p>

    <p class>
      Pair programming results in higher quality code for many reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>Different minds approach the same idea in different ways, so ultimately more ideas will be considered.
        </li>
        <li>
          One person may notice errors that the other did not see, resulting in fewer bugs.
        </li>
        <li>Each programmer can share their ideas and learn from one another. They can also recieve immediate <em>feedback</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Feedback</strong> is also very important. in programming. Feedback allows porgrammers to consider suggestions and criticisms from other programmers in order to optimize their productivity.
