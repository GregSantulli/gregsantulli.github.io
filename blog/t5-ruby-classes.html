  <h4>
    T5: RUBY CLASSES
  </h4>

  <div class="content">

    <p>
      In Ruby, pretty much everything we interact with is an object. All these objects are subject to methods that can be called upon them. In a large program, we are likely to have many different objects, so finding a way to organize these object and their respective methods might be a good idea.
    </p>

    <p>Luckily, Ruby allows us to define <em>Classes</em> that not only allow us to organize objects and their methods, but also to assign specific attributes to each instance of an object belonging to a certain class. To explain this better, let's take a look at an example:
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's say we're writing a program about farms. You might have objects such as <em>farm</em> and <em>animal</em>. Each of these objects might have different methods. Our animal object might take a method <em>feed</em> and our farm object might take somehting like <em>cost_per_acre</em>. These methods, however, cannot be applied to all of our objects. You cannot feed the farm itself and you certanly cannot calculate the acreage of an animal. To designate these methods to their respective objects, we can define classes as such:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      class <span class="class">Farm</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">cost_per_acre</span><br>
        <span class="indent comment">#method definition goes here</span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      </span>
      end<br>
      <br>
      class <span class="class">Animal</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">feed</span><br>
        <span class="indent comment">#method definition goes here</span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      end<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      The above example defines two classes: Farm and Animal. Inside each class, we defined a method that applies to only that class. If we tired to call <em>feed</em> on an instance of the <em>Farm</em> class, we would get an error (and vice versa). Speaking of <em>instances</em>, we can create a new instance of a class as follows:
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      sheep = <span class="class">Animal</span>.new
    </p>

    <p>
      The object <em>sheep</em> is now an instance of the <em>Animal</em> class and thus may have the <em>feed</em> method called upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another very useful feature of classes are their <em>attributes</em>. Instances of classes may be instantiated with attributes we define in an <em>initialize</em> definition:
    </p>

     <p class="code">
      class <span class="class">Farm</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">initialize</span>(owner, acres)
        <span class="indent comment"></span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">cost_per_acre</span><br>
        <span class="indent comment">#method definition</span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      </span>
      end<br>
      <br>
      class <span class="class">Animal</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">initialize</span>(name, color)
        <span class="indent comment"></span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">feed</span><br>
        <span class="indent comment">#method definition</span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      end<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once defining neccessary attributes in the <em>initialize</em> definition, new class instances must be instantiated with all arguments in initialize, otherwise it will return an error:
    </p>

     <p class="code">
      sheep = <span class="class">Animal</span>.new <span class="comment"># Now Returns Argument Error</span><br>
      sheep = <span class="class">Animal</span>.new("Lamb Chop", "white")<span class="comment"> # Ok</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each instance of a class will now contain these unique attributes passed to them upon initialization. This is useful because different anumals will usually have different attributes   such as name, color, number of legs and so fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we know, according to the viariable scope, these attributes are only accessable inside the <em>initialize</em> definition. In order to make these attributes accessible <em>outside</em> of the initialize scope, we must assign them to <em>instance variables</em>:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      class <span class="class">Animal</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">initialize</span>(name, color)<br>
        <span class="indent">
          <span class="indent instance">@name</span> = name<br>
          <span class="indent">
          <span class="indent instance">@color</span> = color
          </span>
        </span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      <span class="indent">def <span class="method">feed</span><br>
        <span class="indent">
          <span class="indent">p "You just fed " + <span class="instance">@name</span></span></span><br>
        <span class="indent">end</span><br>
      end<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Above, we assigned each argument of the initialize method to instance variables. Instance variables are defined with an "@" symbol in front and are usually only defined in the initialize method. We also wrote in a definiton for the <em>feed</em> method, which accesses the @name instance variable. Each instance variable is specific to each instance of a class (hence <em>instance</em> variable).
    </p>

    <p class="code">
      sheep = <span class="class">Animal</span>.new("Lamb Chop", "white")<br>
      pig = <span class="class">Animal</span>.new("Babe", "pink")<br>
      <br>
      sheep.<span class="method">feed</span><br>
      <span class="comment">=> "You just fed Lamb Chop"</span><br>
      pig.<span class="method">feed</span><br>
      <span class="comment">=> "You just fed Babe"</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      As you might see, classes can be very useful when accessing information unique to each object. The prescence of classes and instance variables let certain methods know information specific to each instance of a class.
